## The aesthetic in one sentence

**Slate feels like a piece of cold-pressed slate — black ink on a cool grey ground, nothing
decorative, everything intentional. Meditative. Unhurried. Expensive without showing off.**

The ground is deliberately *cool*, not warm. The product is called Slate; the surface should
read like stone and cold light, not like paper. This is the defining decision of the palette —
every grey leans slightly cool, never warm/beige.

---

## 1. The mood board (mental reference points)

When making a UI decision, ask: does this feel like one of these?

- A slab of honed slate — cool grey, matte, flat
- An Arc'teryx tag — minimal type, confident spacing, monochrome
- A luxury editorial magazine in greyscale — stark contrast, generous white space
- Notion's calm — but cooler, quieter, more human

It does **not** feel like:
- A productivity dashboard (no colour-coded labels, no progress rings)
- A social app (no avatars everywhere, no engagement metrics)
- A Material Design app (no coloured primary buttons, no chunky elevation shadows)
- Warm/beige stationery (the ground is cool grey, not cream)

---

## 2. Colour palette — the one true list

The entire app is monochrome on a cool-grey axis. These are the **only** colours. Every value
here is what ships in the app today — the Tailwind config must match these exactly.

| Token name | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | `#1A1A1A` | Primary text, wordmark, icons, active elements, FAB & profile bg |
| `ink-muted` | `#9E9890` | Card/list preview text, metadata, secondary content |
| `ink-subtle` | `#6B6B6B` | Sign-in subtitle, the quietest readable text |
| `canvas` | `#F0F1F4` | App screen background — cool off-grey, never white, never warm |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | Cards, note containers, folder chips, modals, inputs |
| `surface-raised` | `#FAFAF8` | Hover/pressed surface states |
| `divider` | `#E8E8E6` | Hairline dividers between list rows |
| `crumb` | `#D4D4D2` | Breadcrumb `›` separators, the faintest structural line |
| `search-bg` | `#E6E7EA` | Search bar container tint (cool, sits between canvas and divider) |
| `placeholder` | `#B4B6BB` | Search icon + placeholder text |
| `empty-faint` | `#C8C8C6` | Secondary line in empty states |
| `icon` | `#ADADAB` | Folder/nav icons, inactive breadcrumb text, secondary chip labels, non-primary UI chrome |

```js
// tailwind.config.js → theme.extend.colors — MUST match the table above exactly
colors: {
  ink: '#1A1A1A',
  'ink-muted': '#9E9890',
  'ink-subtle': '#6B6B6B',
  canvas: '#F0F1F4',
  surface: '#FFFFFF',
  'surface-raised': '#FAFAF8',
  divider: '#E8E8E6',
  crumb: '#D4D4D2',
  'search-bg': '#E6E7EA',
  placeholder: '#B4B6BB',
  'empty-faint': '#C8C8C6',
  icon: '#ADADAB',
}
```

> **Migration note:** the old config had unused/drifted tokens (`paper`, `slate-100/200/400/600`,
> a warm `canvas`). Delete them. The table above replaces the entire colour section. Any
> component still using a deleted token name or a raw hex must be updated to a token above.

**Accent colour: none.** No blue, no green, no brand colour for interactive chrome, labels,
buttons, or decoration. The active/selected state is a black fill with white text.

**On colour in luxury design:** True luxury is not the absence of colour — it is the *discipline*
of colour. A single green dot in a field of grey makes the grey feel more intentional. A presence
avatar in mint makes the black wordmark feel heavier. Colour earns its place by being rare.
The rule is not "no colour ever" but "colour only where it carries meaning that monochrome cannot."

**Permitted colour uses — each must carry semantic meaning, not decoration:**

| Use | Colour | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Saved / synced status dot | `#6BBF94` | Live confirmation — "your work is safe" |
| Active editing presence dot | `#6BBF94` | Live signal — "someone is in here right now" |
| Avatar identity circles (presence, share sheet) | Per-user palette | Tell collaborators apart at a glance |
| Destructive action text | System red | Danger — cannot be monochrome without losing the warning |

**Everything else is monochrome.** Buttons, labels, cards, icons, backgrounds, borders — all tokens
from the palette table above. If a colour use isn't in the table above, it does not ship.

---

## 3. Typography

One typeface family, a small number of sizes, never decorative. Negative letter-spacing on
headings is part of the identity — it gives the tight, editorial feel.

**Wordmark font:** `Georgia` (iOS) / `serif` (Android) for the "Slate" wordmark only.
**UI font:** `DMSans` (Expo Google Fonts) for everything else; falls back to system sans.

| Role | Size | Weight | Colour | Special |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| App wordmark "Slate" | 38px | 700 | `ink` | serif, letter-spacing −1.2 |
| Screen / page title | 30px | 700 | `ink` | letter-spacing −0.8 |
| Section heading | 20px | 600 | `ink` | letter-spacing −0.4 |
| Card / list title | 15px | 600 | `ink` | letter-spacing −0.2 |
| Body text | 15px | 400 | `ink` | leading-relaxed |
| Preview text | 13px | 400 | `ink-muted` | lineHeight 18–19, clamp lines |
| Caption / meta | 13px | 400 | `ink-muted` | — |
| Section label | 11px | 500 | `ink-muted` | ALL CAPS, letter-spacing 0.7 |
| Sign-in subtitle | 15px | 400 | `ink-subtle` | — |

**Rules:**
- Never more than two type sizes competing on one screen.
- Section labels (FOLDERS, NOTES) are always the all-caps label style — never body weight.
- Titles are semibold (600). Never bold (700) except the wordmark and page title. Never regular.
- No italic in the UI (only inside markdown editor content).
- Headings `leading-snug`; body `leading-relaxed`.

## 4. Spacing and layout

Generous and unhurried. More space = more premium. These values are what ships today.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Screen horizontal padding | 18px (`px-[18px]`, `H_PAD`) | Every screen's left/right edge |
| Web max-width | 680px, centered | Screens don't stretch on desktop |
| Section gap | 30px (`mt-[30px]`) | Between major sections (Folders → Notes) |
| Grid gap | 10px | Between folder chip columns/rows |
| Card internal padding | 16px (`p-4`) | Inside NoteCard / FolderCard |
| List item padding | 14px vertical, 16px horizontal | Inside NoteListItem rows |
| Bottom scroll padding | 120px | Clears the FAB |
| Icon size | 20px | Inline icons, navigation |
| FAB size | 56px (radius 28) | Floating action button |
| Profile button | 36px (radius 18) | Header avatar |

**Border radii**

| Element | Radius |
|---|---|
| FAB | 28px (circular on 56×56) |
| Profile button | 18px (circular on 36×36) |
| Cards (NoteCard, FolderCard) | 16px (`rounded-2xl`) |
| Note list container | 16px |
| FolderChip | 14px |
| Search bar | 16px (`rounded-2xl`) |
| Sign-in button | 12px (`rounded-xl`) |

**The grouped-card pattern:** a list of items (notes in a folder) lives inside ONE shared
`surface` card with `rounded-2xl` corners. Rows are separated by a `hairlineWidth` `divider`
line, inset 16px from the left — **no gap between rows**. The card floats on `canvas`.

```tsx
// ✅ correct — one card, divider rows
<View className="bg-surface rounded-2xl overflow-hidden">
  <NoteListItem title="Team Intro Doc" preview="…" />
  <View className="bg-divider ml-4" style={{ height: StyleSheet.hairlineWidth }} />
  <NoteListItem title="Sprint Retrospective" preview="…" />
</View>

// ❌ wrong — separate cards with gaps between them
<NoteListItem className="bg-surface rounded-2xl mb-3" … />
<NoteListItem className="bg-surface rounded-2xl mb-3" … />
```

---

## 5. Interactive elements

**Primary action (FAB):**
- Black circle (`bg-ink rounded-full`), white icon, 56×56.
- One per screen maximum. Position: 24px from bottom, 24px from right.

**Buttons:**
> Button system, input styles, and press states are intentionally undefined in v1.
> They will be specified iteratively as screens are built. Do not invent a system —
> ask the human when a new button or interactive pattern is needed for the first time.

**Tappable rows (notes, folders):**
- No visible tap indicator at rest, no chevrons — navigation is implied.
- On press: `activeOpacity` 0.65 for list items, 0.88 for cards/chips — a clean fade, no ripple.

**Input fields:**
- Bottom border only (`border-b border-divider`) at rest; becomes `border-ink` on focus.
- Placeholder in `placeholder` colour. Static label above the field — no floating labels.

---

## 6. Shadows / elevation

Slate uses **very subtle** shadows — present but barely perceptible. The FAB is the most
elevated element; everything else is a whisper. All shadows use `shadowColor: '#000'`.

| Element | shadowOpacity | shadowRadius | elevation (Android) |
|---|---|---|---|
| FAB | 0.22 | 10 | 8 |
| NoteCard | 0.09 | 8 | 3 |
| Note list container | 0.07 | 10 | 2 |
| FolderChip | 0.07 | 6 | 2 |

> These are intentionally low. Do not increase opacity to make cards "pop" — that breaks the
> flat, matte slate feel. If a surface needs to read as separate, it's the `canvas`/`surface`
> contrast doing the work, not the shadow.

---

## 7. Icons

Use `lucide-react-native` exclusively. No mixing icon sets.

- Default size 20px, colour `ink` (#1A1A1A), stroke width 1.5 (Lucide default — don't change).
- Outline only, never filled. Never coloured to draw attention — icons are structural, not decorative.

```tsx
import { Folder, FileText, Plus, ChevronRight } from 'lucide-react-native'
<Folder size={20} color="#1A1A1A" />
```

---

## 8. Motion and feedback

Slow and deliberate. No bouncy animation.

- List/scroll: native `FlatList` behaviour, no override.
- Screen transitions: default Expo Router stack (slide in from right).
- Loaded content: 150ms opacity fade when data arrives (prevents flash).
- **No skeleton loaders** — show nothing until ready, then fade in.
- **Loading indicators are permitted** for genuinely async operations (editor WebView initialising, data fetch on mount). Use `ActivityIndicator` in `ink` or `icon` colour, or a thin indeterminate progress bar. The no-skeleton rule applies to content that has arrived but is still hydrating — not to real async waits.
- Haptics: light impact on note creation (`Haptics.impactAsync(ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)`).
- No confetti, no success animations — the content IS the feedback.

---

## 9. Empty states

No illustrations, no emoji, no graphics. A short line of `ink-muted` text, optionally a second
line of `empty-faint`, centred on screen. Example: "No notes yet." / "Tap + to create one."
The blankness is intentional and on-brand.

---

## 10. Dark mode

**Post-MVP.** Do not add `dark:` variants in v1. A cool-grey dark palette will be defined here
when it ships; until then every screen is light-mode only.

---

## 11. What to avoid

| What | Why it's wrong for Slate |
|---|---|
| Hardcoded hex in components | The whole point of §2 — always use a token |
| Warm/beige greys | The ground is cool slate, not paper |
| Strong drop shadows | Looks like Material Design; breaks the matte feel |
| Coloured folder icons / tags | Breaks the monochrome system |
| Gradient backgrounds | Looks like a fintech app |
| Standalone rounded-rectangle buttons | Use pill or full-width block |
| Emoji in UI text | Breaks the premium, editorial tone |
| Progress bars / streaks / badges | Gamification kills the meditative feel |
| Large avatar photos | This is a notes app, not a social app |
| Chevrons on list rows | Navigation is implied; chevrons add noise |

---

## 12. Screen-level checklist

Before a screen is done:

- [ ] Background is `bg-canvas` (#F0F1F4) — cool grey, not white, not warm
- [ ] Horizontal padding is 18px (`H_PAD`) on all content
- [ ] Web content is capped at 680px and centred
- [ ] Section labels use the all-caps 11px label style
- [ ] All text uses only the type scale in §3
- [ ] **No hardcoded hex anywhere — every colour is a token from §2**
- [ ] Cards use `rounded-2xl` and group their rows with hairline dividers
- [ ] Shadows match the §6 table — not heavier
- [ ] The FAB (if present) is the only primary action on the page
- [ ] Icons are Lucide, size 20, stroke 1.5, `ink` colour
